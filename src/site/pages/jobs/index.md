  - quote: "C'est l'institution qui valorise particulièrement la diversité de
      l'Europe. L'avenir de l'Europe passe par les Régions, ses spécificités,
      leur rôle.  Après avoir travaillé pour la Commission et le Parlement
      respectivement, j'ai été attiré par le CdR qui présente une structure à
      taille humaine, qui permet un contact entre collègues plus personnalisé et
      un rôle dans la structure plus polyvalent. Ici, on ne collabore pas avec
      des \"unités\" ou des \"directions\" mais avec des collègues.  "

  - quote: J'ai trouvé au Comité des Régions une vraie bienveillance entre collègues
      et de la part des supérieurs hiérarchiques. Dans ma direction, les chefs
      d'unité et les directeurs favorisent l'initiative individuelle et ont un
      style de management participatif.  Que l'on soit AST, contractuel, interim
      ou AD, il n'y a pas de différence de traitement. Chacun a droit à la
      parole et s'exprime avec courtoisie. Le Comité des Régions a des valeurs
      fortes en matière d'égalité au travail et de normes environnementales.

      travailler dans une institution politique qui fonctionne de façon
      similaire au Parlement européen mais a un réel ancrage sur le terrain,
      cherche à transformer le monde à partir d'expériences concrètes et vécues.
      Le CdR c'est aussi, pour son personnel, une petite famille agréable, où la
      compétition ne règne pas en maitre et où il fait bon travailler

      taille humaine, où les gens avaient l'air de se connaître et de travailler
      dans une ambiance moins technocrate que dans l'institution où je
      travaillais. Une fois arrivée au CdR, mes \"impressions\" se sont révélées
      fondées et je n'ai jamais plus eu envie de partir. La combinaison du
      caractère international et multiculturel du CdR avec son rôle
      d'institution proche des citoyens et de leur réalité de vie, en fait un
      lieu unique où travailler et œuvrer à la consolidation du projet
      européen."

      at the same time it is a human-sized institution. It is a small world in a

      Yet, we are close to the pulse of EU politics.

  - quote: Travailler au CDR dans une institution Européenne à taille humaine permet
      de pouvoir gérer son action dans son entièreté. D'un point de vue
      sécuritaire, qui est mon domaine d'emploi, il n'est pas rare de devoir
      gérer une "session plénière" ou "la semaine européenne des régions et des
      villes", dès la première réunion de travail jusqu'à la mise en action des
      événements tant opérationnelles que financières. Je suis très attaché au
      Sud-Ouest de la France et le fait de travailler pour le CDR à plus de 1100
      kms de chez moi et ainsi y croiser régulièrement des intervenants ou
      visiteurs originaires de ma région, me donne la possibilité de
      communiquer, d'échanger, d'expliquer et ainsi donne un sens complémentaire
      à ma présence au sein du Comité.

      the good vibes she experienced while working in the Committee of the
      Regions. When I saw the vacancy in IT Projects Coordination and the
      Planning and Reporting cycle I knew it was the next step that I needed in
      my career. At the coR, you stop being a number and become an appreciated
      human being and valuable staff member, and, up to my view, your
      possibilities of growing are higher, at least in the sense of self
      development,
