## Images

## Why is it important?

Images and graphics make content more pleasant and easier to understand for many people, and in particular for those with cognitive and learning disabilities. They serve as cues that are used by people with visual impairments, includind people with low vision, to orient themselves in the content.

However, images are used extensively on websites and can create major barriers when they are not accessible. Accessible images are beneficial in many situations, such as:

- **People using screen readers**: The text alternative can be read aloud or rendered as Braille
- **People using speech input software**: Users can put the focus onto a button or linked image with a single voice command
- **People browsing speech-enabled websites**: The text alternative can be read aloud
- **Mobile web users**: Images can be turned off, especially for data-roaming
- **Search engine optimization (SEO)**: Images become indexable by search engines
